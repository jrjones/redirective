[![CI](https://github.com/jrjones/redirective/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jrjones/redirective/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Redirective is a stateless[^1] Rust micro-service that maps short codes to full URLs using an in-memory table sourced from a Git-backed YAML file. It exposes several HTTP endpoints:
 - `GET /{code}`: 302 redirect to the target URL if found, otherwise 404.
 - `GET /healthz`: health check endpoint.
 - `GET /version`: service version endpoint.
 - `GET /available?code=foobar`: Returns true or false based on whether or not the code passed in the query string is available

If none of the above match, it will look for a matching file or directory in the `static_html` folder, allowing you to host a static site.

404s will redirect to /index.html for now (plan to add a 404.html in a future release.)

Redirective is the codebase for [jrj.io](https://jrj.io).

## Codex
This project was done in part because I was using [Yourls](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS), and it's a little old and bloated. But mostly as a fun project to try out [OpenAI's Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) - to see how I'm getting the best results from it, check out the files in the .codex directory, which I reference frequently in my prompts. Fun stuff. :) I have probably written barely more than half of the code here. 

## Features:
 - Thread-safe, lock-free reads with `ArcSwap`.
 - Hot-reload of mappings on demand via an HTTP webhook (`POST /git-webhook` by default) that pulls the latest `links.yaml` from Git and reloads.
 - Prometheus metrics and structured JSON logging.
 
## Configuration
 - `links.yaml`: contains mappings from codes to URLs. Example provided.
 - `redirective.toml`: service settings (bind address, webhook path, rate limits).
 
## Development
## Utilities

### Exporting from YOURLS

If you have an existing [YOURLS](https://yourls.org) instance, you can export its short URL mappings into a `links.yaml` file compatible with Redirective:

```bash
# Set database connection environment variables:
export YOURLS_DB_HOST=your-db-host
export YOURLS_DB_USER=your-db-user
export YOURLS_DB_PASS=your-db-password
export YOURLS_DB_NAME=your-db-name
# Optional: port (defaults to 3306)
export YOURLS_DB_PORT=3306

# Run the export script to generate links.yaml
scripts/export_yourls.sh > links.yaml
```

This creates a YAML file where each key is the YOURLS keyword and the value is the target URL, ready to be consumed by Redirective.
 ### Prerequisites
 - Rust 1.74+ toolchain
 - Git
 ### Building
 ```bash
 cargo build --release
 ```
 ### Running
 ```bash
 ./target/release/redirective
 ```
 ### Docker
 Build and run via Docker:
```bash
docker build -t redirective:latest .

# Run with SSH deploy key:
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ~/.ssh/id_ed25519:/run/secrets/links_deploy_key:ro \
  redirective:latest

# Or, to hot-reload against a local clone:
git clone git@github.com:jrjones/redirective-links.git ./redirective-links
docker run -v "$PWD/redirective-links":/app \
  -v ~/.ssh/id_ed25519:/run/secrets/links_deploy_key:ro \
  -w /app -p 8080:8080 redirective:latest
```

[^1]: Endpoints are simple GETs; nothing writes user data back to the service. Cache is rebuilt from links.yaml at launch and hot-swapped with ArcSwap (no disk persistence). Background task does git pull --ff-only, then reloads config; failures donâ€™t corrupt cache. Any container that can read the same repo will converge on the same cache; nothing local needs to be replicated... but arguably the the webhook doing a git pull COULD be considered state, but doesn't seem a useful distinction to me.
